# WebGL Boilerplate

## Contributing
If you think something is wrong or could be improved please feel free to open an issue or to submit a pull request.

## Sugestions
If you use `VSCode` I recommend installing the following extensions:
- GLSL Lint;
- Shader languages support for VS Code.

These will pop up errors on your shading language strings literals.
